                <p>Two of our most common services are:

Doggy day care – You’re busy but don’t want your pup to feel alone. We totally understand! 
<br></br>
 That’s why we offer doggy day care, where your pup can run around with other dogs while cared for by our Certified Camp Counselors®. 
 <br></br>
We have spacious play areas for maximum fun.</p> 

<p>
Dog boarding – If you’re going away for a single night or multiple weeks,
<br></br> 
our boarding service treats dogs like family, providing them all-day play, 
lots of attention from our staff, and Campfire Treats™ at night.</p>
